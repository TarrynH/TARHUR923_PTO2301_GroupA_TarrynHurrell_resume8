I created a resume using html and css. 
It makes use of flexbox layouts for multiple different sections
It makes use of the form function whereby a viewer can input their details and a message and it comes directly to my inbox
It makes use of the picture element to create a hero header
It contains in page and out page links
This version of the resume used responsive design to tailor the layout to different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet. laptop, etc
